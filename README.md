# Harvard Athlete Hometowns
This project was done as part of the Harvard Open Data Project, a student organization dedicated to using data science to look at campus issues and life. We wanted to look at how Harvard's student athletes and their hometowns. Our main question was: Where do Harvard athletes come from (both in terms of their hometowns and high schools)? How does this differ when isolating factors of different sports, gender and class?
